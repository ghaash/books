for jquery
render book view index in ajax/jquery
render show in jquery, clickable title to next book
new book renders form on same page

so in terms of steps
1. get the rails backend to render json when the index route is hit
2. on the frontend...make a call to that backend endpoint using jquery's ajax method
3. take the data that is received from the backend and render it to the page using jquery
